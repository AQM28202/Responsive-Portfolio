      <img src="assets/images/ant.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Anthony">

      <p>I'm an extroverted introvert who traded the nightlife for family life. My entire existence revolves around my wife and two daughters. I am a native Charlottean with a background in music and graphic design. I'm also a serial entrepreneur and I've had every job, from club promoter to worship pastor.</p>
      <p>It's probably not apparent from this brief missive, but writing is another passion I possess. I hope some of that passion spills over into my pursuit of this career path, "writing code."</p>
